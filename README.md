# 🎮 Othello Classic AI 🎮

This repository contains the source code for a classic Othello (Reversi) game built in Python. The game features a full graphical user interface (GUI) using **`tkinter`**, audio support via **`pygame`**, and a challenging single-player mode against an AI powered by the **Minimax algorithm** with Alpha-Beta pruning.

> 💡 **Quick Start:** To play, clone the repository, install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and run `python Othello.py`. For a full list of features and setup instructions, see the sections below.

## 📌 Project Overview
The workflow and features implemented in **`Othello.py`** include:

- **Game Engine:**
  - Full implementation of Othello rules, including piece flipping, valid move calculation, and end-game conditions.
  - A modular structure that separates the game logic from the user interface.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  - Built entirely with Python's standard **`tkinter`** library.
  - A multi-screen interface including a splash screen, main menu, options, and game board.
  - Interactive elements created with `tkinter.Canvas` for a custom look and feel.
- **AI Opponent:**
  - An AI player based on the **Minimax algorithm** to find the optimal move.
  - **Alpha-Beta pruning** is implemented to significantly improve the AI's decision-making speed.
  - Three adjustable difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard) that control the algorithm's search depth.
- **Customization & Features:**
  - **Multiple Themes:** Players can choose from different board colors and piece styles, including a special "Batman vs. Superman" theme.
  - **Sound Control:** Background music and sound effects can be toggled on or off in the options menu.
  - **Undo Move:** A feature to take back the last move.
  - **In-Game Help:** A "How to Play" section with images explaining the rules of Othello.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I run this project without installing any libraries?** A: No, you must install `pygame` and `Pillow` first. You can do this easily by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Q: How do I change the theme or piece style?** A: From the main menu, go to the "Options" screen. There you can select your preferred board theme and piece style. The changes will be applied to your next game.

**Q: Is the AI beatable?** A: Yes, especially on the "Easy" and "Normal" difficulty settings. The "Hard" setting provides a significant challenge as the AI searches deeper for the best possible move.
